# Suffix

Write a function that returns a function that transforms its input by adding a particular suffix at the end.

Examples
addLy = addSuffix("ly")

addLy("hopeless") ➞ "hopelessly"
addLy("total") ➞ "totally"

addLess = addSuffix("less")

addLess("fear") ➞ "fearless"
addLess("ruth") ➞ "ruthless"
